<b>Good to Know<br>
      <br>
</b>

Any successful PoC needs to address something your organization cares about. Hence, the first thing you need to do is to: <b>define a business question. </b>

<p>It won't just impress your manager that you think big and have
perspective on the business needs of your organisation (which in
English means you just helped your manager to look good in front of his
management). It will also help you to go through a well scoped PoC and
get the investments you need to be successful. </p>
Without a well defined question, you won't know how to properly model
your data, i.e. what structure to apply at query time, or what data
sets and tools to use to best serve the use case.

<b>Define a Business Question</b><br>For the remainder of this
tutorial, we will present examples in the context of a made up
corporation called DataCo, and our mission is to help the organization
get better insight by asking bigger questions. </font><p>
<font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Scenario : </b>
Your Management: is talking euphorically about Big Data... You: are
carefully skeptical, as it will most likely all land on your desk
anyway. Alternatively it has already landed on you, with the nice
project description of: Go figure this Hadoop thing out... </font></p>
