<b>Scenario : </b>
Your Management: can't believe the magic you do with data and is about to promote you and invest in a new team under your lead... when all hell breaks loose. You get an emergency call - as you are now the go-to person - and your manager is screaming about the loss of sales over the last three days...
You: from slightly excited to under the gun in seconds...well, lucky for you there might be a quick way to find out what is happening...
