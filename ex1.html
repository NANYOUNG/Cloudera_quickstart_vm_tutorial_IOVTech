To answer this question, the first thought might be to look at the transaction data, which should indicate what customers actually do buy and like to buy, right? </span></p>

Seamless integration is important when evaluating any new infrastructure. Hence, it¡¯s important to be able to do what you normally do, and not break any regular BI reports or workloads over the dataset you plan to migrate. </span></p>

<p class="1" style="line-height: 160%; mso-pagination: none; mso-padding-alt: 0.0pt 0.0pt 0.0pt 0.0pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing: 0pt; font-family: ÇÑÄÄ¹ÙÅÁ; mso-ascii-font-family: Century Gothic; mso-font-width: 100%; mso-text-raise: 0.0pt;">

To analyze the transaction data in the new platform, we need to ingest it into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). We need to find a tool that easily transfers structured data from a RDBMS to HDFS, while preserving structure. That enables us to query the data, but not interfere with or break any regular workload on it. 
Apache Sqoop, which is part of CDH, is that tool. The nice thing about Sqoop is that we can automatically load our relational data from MySQL into HDFS, while preserving the structure. 
With a few additional configuration parameters, we can take this one step further and load this relational data directly into a form ready to be queried by Impala (the open source analytic query engine included with CDH). Given that we may want to leverage the power of the Apache Avro file format for other workloads on the cluster (as Avro is a Hadoop optimized file format), we will take a few extra steps to load this data into Impala using the Avro file format, so it is readily available for Impala as well as other workloads. 
You should first log in to the Master Node of your cluster using SSH - you can get the credentials using the instructions on Your Cloudera Cluster. Once you are logged in, you can launch the Sqoop job: 
You should first open a terminal, which you can do by clicking the black "Terminal" icon at the top of your screen or clicking right button of mouse to see the menu.  </span></p>
