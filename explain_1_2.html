<b>Good to Know</b><br>

Any successful PoC needs to address something your organization cares about. Hence, the first thing you need to do is to: <b>define a business question. </b>

<p>It won't just impress your manager that you think big and have perspective on the business needs of your organisation (which in English means you just helped your manager to look good in front of his management). It will also help you to go through a well scoped PoC and get the investments you need to be successful. </p>

Without a well defined question, you won't know how to properly model your data, i.e. what structure to apply at query time, or what data sets and tools to use to best serve the use case.

<b>Define a Business Question</b><br>
For the remainder of this tutorial, we will present examples in the context of a made up corporation called DataCo, and our mission is to help the organization get better insight by asking bigger questions. 

<p>
<b>Scenario : </b>
Your Management: is talking euphorically about Big Data... 
You: are carefully skeptical, as it will most likely all land on your desk anyway. Alternatively it has already landed on you, with the nice project description of: Go figure this Hadoop thing out...
